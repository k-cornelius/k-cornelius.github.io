## Selected Works

### Ellucian
Ellucian serves over 2,900 higher-education institutions across 50 countries, providing the software that runs their institutions.
#### Senior Technical Writer
In this role I created, designed, and maintained user-focused technical documentation for two complex ERP products using a Doc-as-Code approach. I was responsible for release notes, user guides, and reference guides. Below is an example of a reference topic I created:

Customer Defined Aid Year Control page | [DITA XML source](assets/Banner%20Financial%20Aid%20-%20Page%20Reference%20DITA%20XML%20Example.pdf) | [PDF transform](assets/Banner%20Financial%20Aid%20-%20Page%20Reference%20Example%20Topic.pdf)


#### Content Designer
As a content designer for Ellucian, I scoped, designed, maintained, and improved complex conversation flows for an AI virtual assistant, Virtual Advisor. I also corrected 15% of ineffective global content via an innovative, novel solution that was successfully implemented in collaboration with product management and developers. Due to the proprietary nature of Virtual Advisor, I am unable to publish the conversation flows I worked on. 

However, information about the product, including screenshots of the conversation flows I worked on, is available at [Ellucian's website](https://www.ellucian.com/products/student/student-aid/virtual-student-assistant).   

### University of Minnesota Medical School
While at the University of Minnesota Medical School, I greatly improved the medical student experience by creating clear, user‑focused financial aid content and paired it with effective case management for nearly 800 students using $39.5M in aid. By redesigning the content students relied on to navigate student loans and repayment, I helped raise student satisfaction with the school’s debt‑management program from the national average of 75% in 2019 to 92% in 2021.

### University of Illinois Urbana Champaign
My earliest introduction to content design and strategy came while working in the financial aid office at the University of Illinois Urbana Champaign. In addition to developing presentations and publications for the office, I was responsible for content management on the public-facing office website. During my time in this role, the website underwent a complete redesign, and I was tasked with ensuring that the content maintained its accuracy and user-focused approach throughout the project.

Archived versions of the site illustrate the transformation, with before‑and‑after snapshots available through the Internet Archive:
